# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

**Overview:**

This project aims to analyse telecom customer churn using a dataset of 7,043 profiles, uncovering key trends and patterns to inform retention and loyalty strategies.

**Objectives:**

1. Analyse customer churn data to identify underlying trends and patterns.
2. Explore the impact of monthly charges, service types, payment methods, and demographics on churn rates.
3. Develop a comprehensive dashboard visualisation to present key insights in an accessible and intuitive manner.
4. Extract actionable recommendations to help telecom companies mitigate churn, improve customer satisfaction, and cultivate a loyal customer base.
5. Provide insights into emerging trends and technologies in the telecom industry and their potential impact on customer churn dynamics.

**Methodology:**

1. Gather diverse datasets, including demographics, service usage, payment methods, and churn status.
2. Preprocess data by removing inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.
3. Conduct in-depth exploratory analysis to uncover correlations and trends.
4. Develop an interactive dashboard using data visualization tools.
5. Apply statistical techniques to quantify the impact on churn rates.

**📊Key Observations and Insights**

**Monthly charges and customer loyalty**
Churned customers pay an average monthly fee of £74.44, compared with non-churned customers who pay £61.27. This suggests competitors may offer more appealing pricing. Within the first month, 61.99% of customers who signed up for monthly contracts churned, but churn rates decreased over tenure: 32.48% after 1 year, 24.47% after 2 years, and 7.89% after 5 years. However, concerns linger about the low number of loyal customers, hinting at deeper issues.

**Service and Payment method insight**
Fiber Optic users face a high churn rate of 41.89%, while DSL users experience only 18.96%. This indicates potential issues with Fiber Optic services, possibly due to conversion challenges and inadequate support. Payment method choices significantly impact churn rates, with electronic check users at 45.29% and E-bill users at 33.56%, pointing to hurdles in the electronic payment process.

**Demographics**
A youthful demographic dominates at 83.79%, with a churn rate of 23.61%, while the older age group, constituting 16.21%, exhibits a higher churn rate of 41.68%, underscoring the importance of catering to both segments for sustained growth.
